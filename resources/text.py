I had not coded at all but I wanted to so, I went to university and got a bachelor‚Äôs in computer science, then a master‚Äôs in information technology. I had a difficult time finding a job because I lacked experience coding. I struggled answering the questions at technical reviews and solving the coding challenges. I had the knowledge I gained in school but was reluctant to deep dive on my own.

Under Bob and Julian‚Äôs guidance in the Pybites Developer Mindset program, I was able to develop a couple of apps to Minimum Viable Product with one of them online @Render and got another one close to MVP. They also encourage starting a blog, which I am about to post my first article, and putting yourself out there on social media. I am still looking for a job but with the confidence and skill I gained through the program, I am sure it won‚Äôt take me long.

I am a network engineer, so coding has never been on my ‚Äúradar.‚Äù I figured if I could automate some of the mundanity it would be less to worry about from day to day.

I discovered Pybites when searching the internet to understand python classes, I found the code challenge platform shortly after and dove in. As a beginner I can say that coding (in any language) has always seemed daunting so I made no effort to learn. The Pybites platform is structured so that you are coding from the first challenge and I quickly began to see how beneficial the Pybites platform could be, to say nothing of Python itself. I took the plunge and joined the Pybites Developer Mindset program (PDM) to further my growth. Fast forward 11 months and I now have 2 apps of my own creation. My confidence has increased exponentially and I have real world experience in testing, software best practices, deployment, performance, and design patterns.

For anyone wanting to learn Python I can‚Äôt recommend Pybites enough. Bob, Julian, & the entire community have all contributed to my development. You will be surprised at what Pybites can help you accomplish.

Thanks Bob, Julian, and all the other Pybites team members!!

Python rekindled my love of programming and I was very keen to increase my skills and experience.

I decided that two things would really help me to move forward: collaborating on a real project with a mentor, and becoming part of a supportive and experienced community of Python developers.

The PyBites PDM Program gave me both of those things and so much more. A wonderful and unexpected bonus was the motivation, support and camaraderie gained by sharing the journey with other clients in the program. I learned many new skills (technical and mindset), built some cool apps, made some great friends and genuinely had a blast.

If you have the opportunity to take the program ‚Äì just do it!

PDM helped me start transforming my knowledge of Python from an ‚Äúoccasionally and crudely used tool‚Äù into my main tool of choice.

The difference between learning by yourself and taking PDM is like the difference between navigating through an unknown town without a map vs. having a map. Both options can reach the goal, but with a map it‚Äôs way faster and a more efficient use of your time.

And the same applies to PDM: thanks to good mentoring and proper code reviews from an experienced developer, I was able to keep my focus on the important things. Shortly after PDM I even changed to a Python focused job, which is something I could not do with my previous knowledge of Python.

The time with my tutor Ryan was invaluable to me. Direct access to a subject expert in Django on a 1 to 1 basis makes Pybites stand out as different.

Over a few years I had tried to revive my hobby project without success. Ryan and Pybites have helped get me back on the road and equipped me with a much greater understanding of modern Django.

I‚Äôm astonished at how far I‚Äôve come in my career after PDM.

I went from writing my very first Pull Request in the program to leading (by example) several seasoned engineers in the field of Data Engineering.

I now give demos during office hours every week where I provide ‚Äúbites‚Äù of helpful refactoring ideas and showing how we can leverage more of the Standard Library.

This is all in no small part due to the lessons I learned through Pybites and the PDM program. What may seem like just little nuggets of info become an invaluable tool set.
